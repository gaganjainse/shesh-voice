"""Robust lifecycle management for long-running local subprocesses.

Used by handlers that spawn a local server/daemon (`llama-server`,
`sd-server`, ...) so they don't each reinvent the same spawn/kill code.

A single `BackgroundProcess` guarantees:

* The child runs in its **own session/process-group**, so the whole tree
  (the server plus any helper processes it forks) can be torn down together
  without affecting the host process tree.
* `BackgroundProcess.stop` escalates `SIGTERM` -> `SIGKILL` against
  the entire group and *always* reaps the process via `wait()`, so no zombies
  are left behind.
* It is **thread-safe**: concurrent `start`/`stop` calls are serialized.
* An optional crash monitor reaps the process and calls back if it dies on
  its own (i.e. not via `stop`).

Simple usage:

    from .utility.background_process import BackgroundProcess

    self.server = BackgroundProcess("llama-server")
    self.server.register_atexit()
    ...
    self.server.start(
        cmd,
        env=env, cwd=bin_dir,
        on_crash=lambda: GLib.idle_add(self.throw, "crashed", ErrorSeverity.ERROR),
    )
    ...
    self.server.stop()

Note: when the command is launched through `flatpak-spawn --host`, the actual
server runs on the host as a separate session and is not reachable via the
local process group; terminating the `flatpak-spawn` wrapper is still the
best-effort action taken here.
